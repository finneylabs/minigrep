# Minigrep

This project is the one explained on the Rust Programming Language book

The things learned here are:

* IO operations
    - command line with `std::env::args`
    - files with `std::fs`
    - environment variables with `std::env::var`
* Error Handling with `Result<>`
* Standard error redirection
